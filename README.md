üîπ What is a Monitor Lock?

In Java multithreading, every object in memory is associated with a thing called a monitor (or intrinsic lock).

A monitor lock is the mechanism that ensures only one thread can execute a block of code that‚Äôs synchronized on that object at a time.

If multiple threads try to enter a synchronized block/method guarded by the same object, only one thread will hold the monitor lock, and others will wait.

üîπ Where the Monitor Lock Appears

You encounter monitor locks whenever you use the synchronized keyword:

public synchronized void criticalSection() {
// thread must acquire the monitor lock of "this"
// before entering
}


or

synchronized (someObject) {
// thread must acquire the monitor lock of "someObject"
// before executing
}

üîπ Behavior

A thread wants to enter a synchronized method/block.

It tries to acquire the monitor lock of the object it‚Äôs synchronizing on.

If the lock is free ‚Üí thread acquires it and enters.

If the lock is already held ‚Üí thread blocks (waits) until the lock is released.

When the thread exits the synchronized code ‚Üí it releases the monitor lock so another thread can proceed.

üîπ Example
class BankAccount {
private int balance = 100;

    public synchronized void withdraw(int amount) {
        if (balance >= amount) {
            balance -= amount;
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " withdrew " + amount);
        } else {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " insufficient balance!");
        }
    }
}


Here withdraw() is synchronized.

That means before any thread can execute it, the thread must acquire the monitor lock of the BankAccount object (this).

Only one thread at a time can withdraw; others will wait.

üîπ Key Points

Every Java object has one monitor lock.

synchronized keyword uses that lock to enforce mutual exclusion.

Threads competing for the same lock are put into the BLOCKED state until the lock becomes available.

If you use wait(), notify(), notifyAll() ‚Üí they also depend on the monitor lock (a thread must hold the lock before calling them).

üîπ Analogy

Imagine a room with a single key (the monitor lock).

Only one person (thread) can enter the room if they have the key.

If someone else is inside, others must wait outside.

When the person leaves the room, they put the key back ‚Üí then another person can take it and enter.

‚úÖ So, monitor lock = the intrinsic lock of an object, used by synchronized blocks/methods to allow only one thread at a time.

## What is the key rule lets check

üîë Key Rule

Every Java object has a monitor lock (sometimes called an intrinsic lock).

When you use synchronized, you are telling Java:
‚ÄúBefore this code executes, the thread must acquire the monitor lock on a particular object.‚Äù

Only one thread can hold that monitor lock at a time.

üìå Case 1: synchronized on an instance method
class MyClass {
public synchronized void foo() {
// critical section
}
}


Here the lock is on this (the current object).

If one thread is executing foo(), then no other thread can call any other synchronized method on the same object.

But other threads can call synchronized methods on different objects of the same class.

‚úÖ Example:

MyClass obj1 = new MyClass();
MyClass obj2 = new MyClass();

Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> obj1.foo());
Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> obj1.foo()); // blocked until t1 releases lock
Thread t3 = new Thread(() -> obj2.foo()); // runs in parallel with t1, since obj2 != obj1

üìå Case 2: synchronized on a static method
class MyClass {
public static synchronized void bar() {
// critical section
}
}


The lock is taken on the Class object (MyClass.class), not on an instance.

Only one thread can execute any synchronized static method of MyClass at a time.

üìå Case 3: synchronized block
class MyClass {
void baz() {
synchronized(this) {
// critical section
}
}
}


Lock is only held inside the block.

You can also choose to lock on any arbitrary object, e.g. synchronized(someLockObject) { ... }.

‚öñÔ∏è Summary

Instance synchronized method ‚Üí lock on this object.

Static synchronized method ‚Üí lock on the .class object.

Synchronized block ‚Üí lock on whichever object you specify.

So yes ‚Äî when you synchronize a method, the lock is set on the whole object (instance), not just on that method. That‚Äôs why if one thread is in a synchronized method, no other thread can enter any synchronized method on that object.
